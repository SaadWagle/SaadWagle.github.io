### Projects
- Title: BRINGING DATA TO LIFE: CRAFTING REALISTIC SCENARIOS

Overview: This project showcases my data analysis skills and ability to tackle real-life scenarios through compelling dashboards. As part of my transition into a data analyst role, I undertook a solo project at Atliq Hardware, a hypothetical hardware parts supplier aiming to understand the Indian market.

Key Steps:

  Data Extraction from SQL: Extracted raw data from SQL database to lay the groundwork for analysis.
  Data Cleaning and Sorting in Excel: Meticulously cleaned and sorted data in Excel to ensure accuracy and relevance.
  Creating Interactive Dashboards in Power BI: Utilized Power BI to craft interactive dashboards for actionable insights.
  SQL Comments for Realistic Scenarios: Included SQL comments mimicking real-world scenarios to enhance authenticity, such as queries 
  from a Sales Director to Regional Sales Heads.

- Title: DECODING ELECTORAL BONDS & UNDERSTANDING CJI's RULING

Overview: This project focuses on analyzing the potential loopholes and scams in India's electoral bond system, revealing how political parties exploit the system for fundraising. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I uncovered suspicious activities, such as numerous electoral bonds purchased by relatively small corporate entities and a significant disparity between the number of bonds purchased and encashed over the past five years.

Key Highlights:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to identify loopholes and suspicious patterns in the electoral bond system, highlighting discrepancies in bond purchases and encashments.
Machine Learning Prediction: Utilized machine learning algorithms to predict the future purchase denomination by specific purchasers, providing insights into potential future trends and patterns.
This project aims to shed light on the flaws within the electoral bond system and contribute to discussions on improving transparency and accountability in political financing.
